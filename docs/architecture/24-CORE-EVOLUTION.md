# 24 — CORE EVOLUTION

> Core evolution roadmap.

## Evolution Phases

### Phase 1: CLI Tool (Current)
- 10 commands
- 13 core modules
- 9 capabilities
- File-based state
- No inter-module communication

### Phase 2: Adaptive System (Now)
- Event bus for module communication
- Pipeline engine for orchestration
- Feedback loops for learning
- State machine for lifecycle
- Plugin system for extensibility

### Phase 3: Autonomous Governance (Future)
- Self-governing system
- Auto-detection of knowledge gaps
- Auto-recommendation of improvements
- Auto-adaptation to team maturity
- Self-evolving capabilities

## Roadmap

### Q3 2026 — Foundation
- [x] 30 architecture documents
- [x] Event bus implementation
- [x] Pipeline engine implementation
- [x] Feedback loop implementation
- [x] State machine implementation
- [x] Plugin system implementation
- [x] CLI refactor with shared infrastructure

### Q4 2026 — Integration
- [ ] Connect all modules to event bus
- [ ] Wire pipeline into CLI commands
- [ ] Add feedback recording to CLI
- [ ] Implement lifecycle state checks
- [ ] Add plugin loading to init

### Q1 2027 — Intelligence
- [ ] Implement remaining rule engine actions
- [ ] Add confidence scoring to recommendations
- [ ] Implement knowledge graph integration
- [ ] Add graph-based recommendations
- [ ] Implement cross-session learning

### Q2 2027 — Autonomy
- [ ] Self-governance capabilities
- [ ] Auto-detect and remediate knowledge debt
- [ ] Adapt governance rules based on team behavior
- [ ] Generate new capabilities from patterns
- [ ] Self-evolving recommendation engine

## Success Criteria

| Phase | Metric | Target |
|-------|--------|--------|
| Phase 2 | Modules connected via event bus | 100% |
| Phase 2 | Commands using shared infrastructure | 100% |
| Phase 2 | Test coverage for new modules | >80% |
| Phase 3 | Recommendations accepted > rejected | >60% |
| Phase 3 | Knowledge debt reduced over time | Positive trend |
| Phase 3 | System recommends its own improvements | Yes |

## Dependencies

```
Phase 2 (current) depends on:
  - Event bus ✓
  - Pipeline ✓
  - Feedback loops ✓
  - State machine ✓
  - Plugin system ✓

Phase 3 depends on:
  - Phase 2 complete
  - User feedback data (3+ months)
  - Knowledge graph integration
  - Rule engine completion
```
