## Milestones

### M1: Foundation (Q3 2026)
- 30 architecture documents ✓
- 5 infrastructure modules ✓
- CLI refactor ✓
- 164+ tests passing ✓

### M2: Integration (Q4 2026)
- All modules connected to event bus
- Pipeline wired into CLI commands
- Feedback recording in CLI
- Lifecycle state checks in commands
- Plugin loading on init

### M3: Intelligence (Q1 2027)
- Knowledge graph drives recommendations
- Rule engine fully implemented
- Confidence scoring from feedback
- Cross-session learning active

### M4: Autonomy (Q2 2027)
- System detects its own knowledge gaps
- System recommends its own improvements
- System adapts rules based on team behavior
- System evolves capabilities from patterns

## Dependencies

```
M1 ──→ M2 ──→ M3 ──→ M4
│       │       │       │
│       │       │       └─ Requires 6+ months of feedback data
│       │       └─ Requires knowledge graph integration
│       └─ Requires event bus wiring
└─ Complete (current)

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| Event bus performance | High | Low | Benchmark early, optimize if needed |
| Plugin security | High | Medium | Sandboxing in future, documentation now |
| Feedback data cold start | Medium | High | Use defaults until enough data |
| Breaking changes | High | Low | Backward-compatible additions only |
| Scope creep | Medium | High | Stick to roadmap, defer nice-to-haves |

## Success Metrics

| Metric | M1 | M2 | M3 | M4 |
|--------|----|----|----|----|
| Architecture docs | 30 | 30 | 35 | 40 |
| Core modules | 18 | 18 | 20 | 22 |
| Test coverage | 80% | 85% | 90% | 90% |
| Modules connected | 0% | 100% | 100% | 100% |
| Recommendations accepted | — | — | >50% | >60% |
| Knowledge debt trend | — | — | Decreasing | Decreasing |
