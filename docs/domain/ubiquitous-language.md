# Ubiquitous Language

> Official domain specification of the Nexus System. Every term here has exactly one meaning. When in doubt, refer here.

This is the primary conceptual reference of the project. In case of conflict between documents, the definition in this Domain layer prevails.

---

## Observation

- **Definition:** A perception of something in the project that deserves attention. It is the rawest form of knowledge — an insight before it is validated or formalized.
- **Responsibility:** Capture what was noticed. Nothing more.
- **When born:** Stage 1 of the Knowledge Lifecycle. The moment someone — human or AI — notices a pattern, an anomaly, a risk, or an opportunity.
- **Produced by:** Engineers, AI agents, monitoring systems, analysis engines.
- **Consumed by:** Hypothesis stage, Knowledge Engine, pattern detectors.
- **Relationships:** → Hypothesis (when validated), → Knowledge (when formalized), → Knowledge Debt (when not captured).
- **Examples:** "When I forget to run tests before committing, bugs slip through." / "This module has been modified 47 times in 3 months."
- **Anti-examples:** A measured metric (that is a Measurement, not an Observation). A documented decision (that is Knowledge, not an Observation).

---

## Knowledge

- **Definition:** Validated understanding that has been formalized and stored persistently. Knowledge is information that has been processed, connected, and made actionable.
- **Responsibility:** Represent what the team knows in a form that can be referenced, connected, and evolved.
- **When born:** When an Observation passes through formalization stages (Hypothesis → Experiment → Decision → Record).
- **Produced by:** Humans (through decisions), AI agents (through analysis), the Knowledge Lifecycle (through formalization).
- **Consumed by:** Engineering Assets (as content), Capabilities (as foundation), Decisions (as context), AI agents (as governed input).
- **Relationships:** ← Observation (source), → Engineering Assets (container), → Decisions (context), → Capabilities (foundation).
- **Examples:** An ADR recording why a database was chosen. / A skill describing when to apply TDD. / A contract defining AI agent permissions.
- **Anti-examples:** A raw metric (that is Data, not Knowledge). A session note (that is Memory, not Knowledge). An unvalidated assumption (that is a Hypothesis, not Knowledge).

---

## Engineering Asset

- **Definition:** A persistent artifact that contains knowledge. Engineering Assets are the containers of knowledge — they make knowledge tangible, storable, and connectable.
- **Responsibility:** Persist knowledge in a form that can be discovered, referenced, and evolved.
- **When born:** When knowledge is recorded in a structured format (ADR, Skill, Contract, Workflow, Runbook, Script).
- **Produced by:** Engineers (through documentation), AI agents (through generation), the scaffolding system (through templates).
- **Consumed by:** Humans (for reference), AI agents (for context), the Knowledge Graph (for relations), Capabilities (for detection).
- **Relationships:** ← Knowledge (content), → Knowledge Graph (as nodes), → Capabilities (as detection criteria), → AI Context (as governed input).
- **Examples:** ADR-001.md / skill-tdd.md / contract-frontend-agent.yaml / workflow-feature.md / runbook-deploy.md
- **Anti-examples:** A temporary session note (that is Memory). A computed metric (that is State). A raw log entry (that is Data).

## Capability

- **Definition:** A modular unit of governance functionality that represents a dimension of engineering maturity. Capabilities are not features — they are commitments to govern a specific aspect of engineering practice.
- **Responsibility:** Encapsulate a coherent set of governance behaviors that strengthen a specific maturity dimension.
- **When born:** When a team needs to govern a new aspect of their engineering practice (e.g., AI integration, compliance, metrics).

- **Consumed by:** Engineering State (as a component of maturity), Recommendations (as installable units), the Upgrade process (as targets).
- **Relationships:** ← Maturity Profile (dimension scores drive recommendation), → Engineering Assets (creates file structures), → Engineering State (installed capabilities affect score).
- **Examples:** `core`, `knowledge`, `architecture`, `governance`, `ai`, `quality`, `metrics`, `operations`, `compliance`.
- **Anti-examples:** A CLI command (that is a Functionality, not a Capability). A configuration option (that is a Setting, not a Capability).

---

## Engineering State

- **Definition:** The measurable condition of a project's engineering practices, governance maturity, and knowledge health at a specific point in time. It is the single source of truth for understanding a project's actual condition.
- **Responsibility:** Answer three questions: Where are we now? What's wrong? What should we do next?
- **When born:** When the system first analyzes a project. Updated on each subsequent analysis.

- **Responsibility:** Execute decisions in a way that is traceable, reversible when possible, and consistent with governance rules.
- **When born:** When a decision is translated into specific operations (create file, update record, install capability, run script).

- **Responsibility:** Automate governance behaviors without requiring human intervention for routine decisions.
- **When born:** When a governance behavior needs to be automated (e.g., "when a session starts, load context hierarchy").
- **Produced by:** Humans (through definition), AI agents (through recommendation), the Rule Engine (through evaluation).

- **Anti-examples:** A log message (that is Diagnostic, not an Event). A metric update (that is Measurement, not an Event). A file change (that is a Side Effect, not an Event).

---

## Feedback Loop

- **Definition:** A cycle where the acceptance or rejection of recommendations influences future recommendations. The system learns from human decisions.
- **Responsibility:** Ensure that the system improves its recommendations over time based on actual outcomes.
- **When born:** When a recommendation is accepted or rejected by a human.
- **Produced by:** The Feedback system (through recording of outcomes).
- **Consumed by:** Recommendations (as learning input), Evolution (as evidence of improvement).
- **Relationships:** ← Recommendations (source), ← Humans (acceptance/rejection), → Recommendations (learning input), → Evolution (evidence).
- **Examples:** "Recommendation to install `ai` capability was accepted → increase confidence for similar recommendations." / "Recommendation to restructure was rejected → decrease confidence for similar recommendations."
- **Anti-examples:** A one-time correction (that is a Fix, not a Feedback Loop). A survey response (that is Perception, not a Feedback Loop). A metric change (that is Measurement, not a Feedback Loop).
